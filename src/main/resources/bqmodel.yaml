  description: identity
  definition: "The modelling object represented by the model element is identical with the subject of the referenced resource (modelling object B). For instance, this qualifier might be used to link an encoded model to a database of models."

  description: origin
  definition: "The modelling object represented by the model element is derived from the modelling object represented by the referenced resource (modelling object B). This relation may be used, for instance, to express a refinement or adaptation in usage for a previously described modelling component."

  description: description
  definition: "The modelling object represented by the model element is described by the subject of the referenced resource (modelling object B). This relation might be used to link a model or a kinetic law to the literature that describes it."

  description: class
  definition: "The modelling object represented by the model element is an instance of the subject of the referenced resource (modelling object B). For instance, this qualifier might be used to link a specific model with its generic form."
